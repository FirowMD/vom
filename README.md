`vom` is a rewrite of [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom "nom"), which is a parser combinator library.
It is written in V, hence the name.

## Why use vom?

- The parsers are small and easy to write
- The parsers components are easy to reuse
- The parsers components are easy to test separately
- The parser combination code looks close to the grammar you would have written
- You can build partial parsers, specific to the data you need at the moment, and ignore the rest
